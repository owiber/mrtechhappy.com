          <p>Not quite sure who started the 
    idea, but somehow, Van, Brook, Oliver, and eventually Mark decided to do an 
    online comic. With initial drawings and concepts from Brook, everyone 
      (except Mark who sat there giving critiques to the three the whole time) 
      began doing a bit of artwork.</p>
          <p>As you will notice, the first few comics 
      aren't really too great in comedic value. The reason  is that we 
      merely threw in inside-jokes as &quot;space-fillers&quot; in order for us to get 
      used to the artwork... all those early comics were basically us 
      practicing.</p>
      <p>If you look at the archives, you'll also notice that
      <a href="index0b96.html?day=010730">JELLY... 
      JELLY!!!</a> was the last comic to be up in 2001 and the next comic was 
      New Years, 2002... five months later. As it turned out, we made our 
      characters a bit too complex for ourselves to easily duplicated and thus, 
      whenever we had a comic, our laziness would get the better of us when we 
      thought of how much work it would require for us to draw JUST ONE person 
      in another position. At that time, it would take us up to a few HOURS to 
      complete just one character to our satisfaction. I believe the character 
      that took us the longest and turned out the best was &quot;Oliver's Dream Girl&quot; 
      who never actually showed up in a comic until much later in
      <a href="index967e.html?day=020113">ZZZzzzzzz</a><font color="#FFFFFF">. 
      There's a story that goes along with &quot;her&quot; too... but I'll leave that for 
      another time. ;)</font></font></p>

          <p>As it seems, &quot;MrTechHappy&quot; has nothing to do with the comic at all. 
          And... you'd be pretty much correct if you made that assumption. 
          Oliver, Chad, and Van competed in
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bpa.org/">BPA</a> (Business 
          Professionals of America) during their high-school senior year. Having 
          not much pride in their school or the BPA organization itself, the 
          trio decided to make a comedic website to compete.</p>
          <p>The website was &quot;MrTechHappy.com&quot; and was a robot business... with 
          many bits of humor scattered throughout the entire site. That year, we 
          took... eh... 4th in State I believe... or maybe it was 5th... I 
          really don't remember anymore. Anyhow, after we had no use for the 
          domain name and we had already spent the money on it, we decided to 
          recycle it and make it and use it for our webcomic.</p>
          <p>However, we do have plans on somehow incorporating &quot;MrTechHappy&quot; 
          into our comic as an actual entity... you'll have to wait and find 
          out... there are a few small small hints in a few of the comics, 
          although they'd be very hard to get if you knew nothing about our 
          previous BPA website.</p>

      <p>Since our old style was not working out, Brook and Oliver (Van had 
      recessed into his non-broadband home and remained hidden for quite some 
      time - Mark was hibernating) decided there needed to be a change.</p>
      <p>At the moment, Brook, being in high school, had much spare time and 
      began to once again doodle in Flash. He created little miniature versions 
      of people he knew. After looking at them, Oliver decided they would be 
      very good characters for MrTechHappy. So with a little bit more refinement 
      and group work (with critiques from Mark), MrTechHappy was born again 
      after it came to a quick death.</p>
      <p>Now that MrTechHappy was off to a good start again, we decided to 
      change hosts from the free service,
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.doteasy.com/">DotEasy.com</a>, to a 
      host that allowed us to do more advanced scripting, was faster, and 
      allowed more space - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.addr.com/">
      Addr.com</a>.</p>
      <p>After a night and a few hours later, Oliver had coded much of the 
      site's backend PHP (which constantly, at least seemingly to Oliver, is 
      needing tweaking to satisfy the evil cravings of the other TechHappy 
      authors) and transferred the older comics into Oliver's psuedo-database.</p>
      <p>With all that done, we began trying to shift away from inside jokes to 
      more &quot;widely-gotten&quot; jokes... we'll see how that turns out.</p>
      <p>That's where we are now. =)</p>

          <p>Ah... about us?...</p>
          <p>Oliver Wong is currently a Computer Science major at the
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at 
          Austin</a> and likes to call his major, &quot;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.counter-strike.net/">Counter-Strike</a>.&quot; 
          Having not a great deal of school pride, even in college, he is 
          semi-phobic of swarms of orange which sometimes spring up from nowhere 
          on weekends during the Fall semester. He's the webdesigner and coder 
          for MrTechHappy and has also been doing a majority of the artwork for 
          the comics, basing them off of Brook's original concepts.</p>
          <p>Brook Shelley is a Senior at McNeil High School in Austin (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.roundrockisd.org/">Round 
          Rock ISD</a>) and hopes/plans on going to UT along with the rest of 
          the college-goers in this comic next Fall. He's responsible for the 
          majority of the comic's origins and concepts and does a lot of the 
          writing/scripts for each comic. He has two darned cats which fur up 
          everything and everyone.</p>
          <p>Mark Brandt dropped out of high school and got a G.E.D. to play 
          video games - at least that's the reason we like to think he did it 
          for. He achieved the unthinkable - became a full-time gamer and 
          dropped out of school to do it! GO MARK! We believe all that &quot;I just 
          wanted to<i> actually </i>learn stuff&quot; is just a bunch of B.S. that he 
          throws at his parents. =) Although, he did manage to score a 1560 on 
          the SAT, whipping the snot out of everyone else here... so we are 
          forced to concede he does have some brains. ;) He also plans on 
          attending UT in the near future and provides critiques and scripts to 
          MrTechHappy.</p>
          <p>Chad Wilson is majoring (for the moment =) in Mathematics at UT. As 
          horrific as it may sound to his past teachers, he plans to join their 
          ranks in the future and also teach (hide your kids... heh, just 
          kidding ;). He, like Mark, provides critiques and comic ideas. Oh, he 
          also has Metal Gear Solid 2, but has yet to finish it.</p>
          <p>Van Nguyen is going the double-E (Electrical Engineering) route at 
          UT... but may in fact end up double-majoring in Computer Science 
          and/or spending the rest of his life in college. After fading away 
          from the MrTechHappy scene for a little while, he should be joining us 
          again shortly as an author due to his recent broadband attainment. We 
          look forward to his return to bring us better/more artwork and comic 
          ideas.</p>
