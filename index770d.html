	Mmm… Zhang Ziyi… I have to wonder, though, whether Oliver's mom will look at this and think "My son is looking at women!?!?" or "Aww, I'm glad he met a nice Chinese girl…"
<br>
<br>Now, I'm sure a lot of you have been wondering, "Hey, where's Mark been? He's the only thing that makes this site worth anything!" Ya see, I was doing field research to make sure we have an adequate supply of funny once our reserves in Bahrain dry up. Luckily, I managed to line up a supplier from the United Arab Emarates.
<br>
<br>Let's move on to more pressing business. I'd like to (for the most part) recant my <a href="index2060.html?day=020212">prior assessment</a> of blitzball… You see, the situation they stick you in for your first game is bad, but once you've learned the ropes, it is by far the most enjoyable mini-game in FFX. Of course, its competition is less than fierce, because one of the runners up is a game in which you press the X button when the screen flashes in order to dodge lightning. In order to win, you have to do  so 200 times consecutively (without messing up) or go insane from the music, in which case, everyone's a winner! It reminded me of some of those really bad dance games, only without the variety, crazy J-pop, or fun. I miss the incredibly well done mini-games that were in FFIX (except for that horrible, horrible card game). I would play chocobo digging until the cows came home, at which point I would go catch a metric ton of frogs.
<br>
<br>I stole Oliver's copy of Return to Castle Wolfenstein, and (like everyone else) discovered that killing zombies is not enjoyable at all. Often times I would encounter some zombies fighting Nazi soldiers, and would take out the zombies as quickly as possible so  that the Nazis would survive and I could find the slightest bit of enjoyment. I have a dream that one day we can join with our zombie bretheren and rise up together against our Nazi oppressors.
<br>
<br>Brook alerted me to a nearby Asian market that sells the very delicious and addictive Men's Pocky. I am now quite positive that I am the type of person who enjoys the finer points in life. However, I do still occasionally lighten up my day with Mousse Pocky's super smooth aero-chocolate. I was planning on linking to Pocky's web site to inform our viewers of it's splendor, but apparently Glico thinks a web site should consist of many pictures of young Japanese girls in short skirts eating their product. That combined with the fact that what little text it contains is in Japanese means the site is of little use to you.
<br>
<br>There was a documentary on the other day about a group of prisoners' plan to escape from a Nazi castle turned prison camp. Their original attempt went fould at the last minute, and a mass escape from another camp resulted in much tighter security, so they only had one way out: the sky. They built a false wall in an attic so that guards wouldn't notice the workshop when they did their rounds. They then used various pieces of wood and other common materials to build a glider, which they would use to fly off the roof. Unfortunately, it took so long to build that the war was almost over by the time it was finished. The documenters gathered all the surviving members of the groups that built it, and created a replica of the glider (using some more standard procedures, but otherwise following the design to the letter… they even used the same type of cloth to cover it and the same food based mix to harden the cloth). The guy who was going to pilot the original got in, the dragged it with a rope to get it into the air, at which point it flew like nobody's business. It was pretty amazing how good their desing was.
<br>
<br>I had a strange dream right before watching the aforementioned show, and I wil recount it here to the best of my ability. It took place at a building similar to a school, but not quite… the closest approximation I can make is a community college. As I exitted the building, I ran into an acquaintance of mine, who quickly informed me that she had just killed two people and needed my assistance in taking care of the bodies. I can't recall the reason she gave for murdering them, but I obviously found it adequate since I grabbed one of the bodies and helped throw it over a fence. We had taken one of the bodies to a nearby van, where we stashed it for transportation. My friend was off getting the other body, and I was inside the van when a man and woman bust in. They were quite startled to see me cutting up a cadaver, but the man quickly drew his pistol and informed me that this was an FBI van. The woman was a teach at the school, and apparently there was going to be some kind of sting there. In any case, I knew I was done for, when outside the window I spotted the three pronged crane/claw thing (similar to those in the <a href="index31ec.html?day=020108">toy grabbing games</a>, only much more heavy duty and with a razor sharp tip) that the girl had been using to move the other body. She smashed it through the window, knocked down both the people, and put it against the FBI agent's throat. We had to be fast, so I grabbed the axe and/or knife I had been using the cut up the body and killed the lawman and the professor. Now we had twice the number of bodies to deal with, but they were all in the van. We went back inside the school to take care of one last thing (or maybe get a soda… hauling bodies around is thirsty work), and as we were going out the door, we became aware of some impending danger. I have no idea now what this danger was (possibly some FBI agents who were going to find out what was taking their partner so long), but my dream self was certain that there was little time to get to the van and drive away. I was so tired from carrying the corpses around, however, that I couldn't run far. To be more accurate, it felt more like I couldn't get any traction with the ground (pretty much every time I dream something is chasing me, my brain thinks it should add suspense to the dream by making me "tired" and then gradually make it impossible to run). I hadn't gotten far at all and knew there was no way I could escape the impending doom, whereas my partner in crime had made it to the van. The whole ordeal has made us become quite close, and (knowing I couldn't escape) I was desparately hoping she would take off to freedom without me. It was at this point that I woke up and reallized what a derranged dream I had just had…
<br>
<br>I was going to scan the Men's Pocky box to use as my new signature graphics, but my dad threw it away. Fear not, citizens, for I shall retrieve more crispy biscuit stick covered in dark chocolate shortly!</font></td></tr>
