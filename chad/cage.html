<body><h1>A Rational Cage</h1><p>
It emerges from nowhere.<br>
Complacent hopes<br>
That you might feel the way i feel.<br>
i look,<br>
it's tied,<br>
my rope.<br><p>

i examine the inside of my heart<br>
and all i see are the walls,<br>
heights comprised of rough stone,<br>
from which you cannot but fall.<br>
You tell me this is where you belong,<br>
and i genuinely agree.<br>
Ignorance paints a smile,<br>
Elsewhere you eventually will be.<br><p>

My heart thinks it knows what it feels.<br>
But it's under the control of you.<br>
Hope the lingering lingerie.<br>
I don't think you could say<br>
what i want you to.<br>
Everything is stunning,<br>
Everything is incredibly right.<br>
You tell me i am yours until forever,<br>
or at least tomorrow night.<br><p>

Tonight until forever,<br>
The finite span i can't comprehend.<br>
Forever comes with a picnic basket<br>
Bringing with it "the end".<br>
</body>
