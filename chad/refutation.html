<body><h1>Dissenting Opinion (Unspoken, Unmentioned)</h1>
It's there, not to be ignored,<br>
But my mind will run away.<br>
Run away from that thing:<br>
Unspoken, unmentioned...<br>
A scratch at the surface<br>
But can not bring more.<br>
Nothing more; it's too obvious.<br>
There is nothing at all,<br>
Everything is...<br>
Unspoken, unmentioned.<br>
Not a word will flow,<br>
Or even drip; one drop would do.<br>
Or wou--what would it do?<br>
Torment, maim, destroy, reveal?<br>
It is-was-always will be<br>
Unspoken, unmentioned.<br>
