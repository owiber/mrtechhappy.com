<h1>A Negative Summation</h1>
Sometimes i begin to ponder<br>
The existence of man<br>
Minus the existence of you.<br>
This can only lead me to wonder<br>
Where i placed my cowboy hat.<br>
I've always had trouble staying on topic.<br>
And this is a crime worthy of death.<br>
At least that seems to be<br>
The way you enjoyed seeing things<br>
As the ultimate and final judge of my life.<br>
The difference of man's existence and yours<br>
Is a death row pardon from the governor.<br>
Which creates a timeless paradox,<br>
As i send myself to that prison again.<br><p><p><a href="index.html" target="_self">Back to main.</a>
