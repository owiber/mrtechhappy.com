<h1>A Bloody Victory</h1><p><p><p>
You laugh.<br>
A smile can't help but iron itself to my face.<br>
Whereas few things feel better<br>
Than seeing contentment overwhelm you,<br>
And, thus, overwhelm me.<br>
What fool would steal this joy away from you?<br>
I'm sure any <i>fool</i> would...<br>
Hence, to maintain slight intelligence,<br>
And overall happiness,<br>
I hurriedly and dejectedly<br>
Separate my existence from yours.<br><p><p><a href="index.html" target="_self">Back to main.</a>
