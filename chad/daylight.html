<h1>Daylight</h1>
There goes a little bunny,<br>
Playing with his beloved peers.<br>
Puppies romp through the grass<br>
Tackling and tugging another's ears.<br><p>

A butterfly floats past my view<br>
It's wings inspiring the cool breeze.<br>
Even the crows are singing a beautiful song<br>
That would bring the scary straw man to his knees.<br><p>

And as the cute little squirrels<br>
chase one another from limb to limb,<br>
The sun sits upon high and eluminates<br>
All those creatures living below him.<br><p><p><a href="index.html" target="_self">Back to main.</a>
