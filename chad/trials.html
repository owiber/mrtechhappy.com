<h1>Trials</h1>
It’s hot as Hell.<br>
I trudge through the desert,<br>
Desiring nothing more<br>
Than the grass I dug up<br>
And replaced with asphalt.<br>
I’m stuck in this parking lot,<br>
Holding up traffic.<br>
Can I ever shift to "drive"?<br><p>

What, even then, would be held for me?<br>
An infinite expansion of glassy-sharp sand,<br>
Cutting my feet and torturing my soul...<br>
I am ready to lie down,<br>
Allowing death to scorch my back.<br>
It is undeniably easier to sink,<br>
Sand eroding at everything<br>
That COULD have been me.<br>
Synonymous now only to pain.<br><p>

And as the sun refuses to relocate itself,<br>
It’s rays illuminate a radiant green<br>
That all but pierce my eyes.<br>
It’s time now to roll the dice.<br>
Is a distant mirage worth chasing?<br>
In this interminable desert,<br>
The fool who didn’t would surely die.<br><p>

Desperate now, I take myself out of "park"<br>
Rushing aggressively forward,<br>
Ignoring all that had previously discouraged me,<br>
Desiring fervently my own existence,<br>
And dismissing the seemingly futile hope<br>
That those vehicles behind me,<br>
May actually follow me with support,<br>
Or even follow at all.<br><p>

Have I finally attained this fabled destination?<br>
Is a mirage truly a mirage<br>
If it does not dissipate into nothingness?<br>
So as I drink from the life-sustaining water,<br>
That could only be provided<br>
In an oasis such as this,<br>
I look up to witness the cool breeze<br>
Disrupting the leaves on the trees,<br>
Whispering softly past my body,<br>
And healing those burns that once tormented me.<br><p><p><a href="index.html" target="_self">Back to main.</a>
