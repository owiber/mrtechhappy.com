<h1>Exactly Why?</h1><p><p><p>
i had pined over you for too long...<br>
Bitterness sets in as you say to me<br>
That which you have yet<br>
To cease saying to me.<br>
"Who are you?" stabs my brain.<br>
The "I hate you" never quite helps either...<br>
i'm falling off a bridge.<br>
A metaphor?<br>
No, you pushed me damn you.<br>
As i crawl out of the waterless creek,<br>
(no mercy)<br>
i look around,<br>
But your existence has disentegrated,<br>
And rematerialized into the arms of Somebody.<br>
So, i eagerly anticipate tomorrow<br>
When i know the gun will point at me again.<br>
And i will do anything i can for you<br>
Knowing you will inevitably,<br>
And incessantly,<br>
Blow the Nobody away...
