<h1>Crap By Definition</h1>
Well, it's today again<br>
And so we spiral into infinite "happiness".<br>
Some people wish this day would never end.<br>
And for many others, it never does.<br>
We will eat our breakfast lunch and dinner,<br>
And oh boy will we love it.<br>
And we will talk to people;<br>
Make them aware that we care.<br>
Circumnavigating tomorrow<br>
And running like hell from yesterday.<br>
And where will we run?<br>
Straight into those comfortable shoes.<br>
The older they get,<br>
They still won't grow old.<br>
So while we propel ourselves<br>
Into that ominous black hole,<br>
We manage to avoid<br>
(And completely to our content)<br>
That interminable crevice that is the human soul.<br><p><p><a href="index.html" target="_self">Back to main.</a>
