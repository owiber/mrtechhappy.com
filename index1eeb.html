	Mark's become obsessed with astrolabes... thus the title. He urged me to put astrolabes IN the comic, but we rejected him multiple times. Poor Mark.
<br>
<br>That is all.
<br>
<br>Oh, and by the way... I got a little message from my comic self during a nap:
<br><blockquote><i>As much as Brook would like to think, I am not evil. She stole my freakin' sword, dang it! Revenge shall be mine!!!!</i></blockquote>Well, there you have it folks... both sides of the coin. Erhm.. something like that.
<br>
<br>Ah... and <a href=about.html>the about page</a> is now up... and... <a href=links.html>links page</a>.</font></td></tr>
     	<tr><td width="725"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#003366"><a name="brook"><a href="mailto:brook@mrtechhappy.com"><img border="0" src="brook.jpg" align="left" width="141" height="64"></a>
	This comic deals with the subject of last nights movie going experience.  I say experience because of the whole "ending up in another city" part.
<br>
<br>Ya see, it all started out on a beautiful winter's eve; having just met everyone at my house and splitting up into two groups,(one to pick up Viraj, one to freeze outside while waiting for Viraj) we headed towards the theater.  Unfortunately, this theater was around 30 minutes from my house... without traffic.  We did consider this in our calculations though, as we left an hour early.  The drive down I-35 was uneventful, Oliver all the while assuring us that he had "been to this theater before," and, "knew how to get there."  We, in our stupidity, believed the crazy boy, and I even took the exit that Oliver pointed out.  Little did we know that his idea of, "It's the next exit, I promise..." meant a jaunt to the neighboring villa of Buda (pronounced with all the hick you can muster as B U da... yes you must use three syllables).  The scene in our comic in fact did take place, including the actual lines uttered by our chibi selves.
<br>
<br>The hate I have for "Super-Navigator" Oliver had no bound... until I got done watching the movie for free.  Yay.  Now I have forgiven him, though, I have learned my lesson... never trust Oliver's directions for they are "Wong."  (insert chuckle)
<br>
<br>In other news... I am now the proud owner... shipping pending... of a miniture S2000 R/C car.  I made my purchase on E-Bay, and it should be here in a week or so.  Yay.  The little car is only 6cm long... wow.  Pocket R/C here I come.  In fact... everyone should own one of these... so get over to <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a> right now and buy yourself one.  They are called "Bit Char-g" cars (Pronounced Bit Charge... crazy Japanese guys), and are the coolest thing since <a href="http://www.hatsofmeat.com/">Tender Juicy Hats</a>.  Buy, buy, buy... and then bring on the race challenges.  My 1337 driving skills will leave you in the dust as we burn micro rubber across the great "Kitchen Floor Raceway."
<br>
<br>Finally, in case you actually keep up with this comic (thanks you three), and you are wondering, "How can Oliver and Megan be riding in the same car without fighting?!?"  Look no further than tommorow's comic, as it will be an epic struggle between the forces of good, Megan... and the forces of evil, Oliver and Van.  All I can say is, start popping that popcorn now... it is gonna be one heck of a battle.  Oh, and, "If you will look under your chair, you will find safety goggles and earplugs..."
<br>
<br>Peace out...
<br>
<br>"If you can convice someone that they are in Canada... you can charge them more for magazines."  </font></td></tr>
     	<tr><td width="725"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFCC00"><a name="mark"><a href="mailto:mark@mrtechhappy.com"><img border="0" src="mark.jpg" align="left" width="141" height="64"></a>
	I'm disobeying bold red text on the updater thing telling me not to do anything, so if something horrible happens, it's not my fault. [Update:The red text isn't there any more, and Oliver tested stuff while I was writing this. Neat]
<br>
<br>For those of you who are curious, that is the actual population of Buda, Texas according to their website.
<br>
<br>I'm not exactly obsessed with <a href="http://www.astrolabes.org/">astrolabes,</a> they're just the coolest navigational tool ever. Of course, if Oliver had an astrolabe in their outing, he could have determined their latitude and known just how far south they were. My other gripe with the comic is that Megan and Oliver are together with seemingly no problems. Hopefully we found a good way to explain that, and you'll see tomorrow if it works out. Since I'm testing some of Oliver's new backend, I figured I'd give you this image of a Moorish astrolabe in the process. Enjoy.
<br><center><img src="images/astrolabe.jpg" border="1" alt="MrTechHappy.com" width="200" height="200"></center>
<br>
<br>Apparently our audience at the moment has absolutely no knowledge of Oldies song lyrics, since none of you figured out that I made up the entire third paragraph of my <a href="index1ad5.html?day=020121#mark">last post</a> for the sole purpose of including a line from <a href="images/CADreaming.mp3">"California Dreaming"</a>* by The Mamas and the Papas. Hopefully you guys won't do so poorly today since it will be inserted (or maybe already has been inserted) more obviously, but we'll see.
<br>
<br>As I noted on the <a href="cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.html">forums</a>, since a growing number of people I'm acquainted with are using AIM instead of ICQ, I went ahead and downloaded <A HREF="http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/">Trillian</a> to talk to you fools. I had quite a time finding a screen name, and despite the fact that I couldn't even use Beechwood-45789, you can call me up at "StabYouSoMuch." Apparently I'm a rebel now for using ICQ and Netscape instead of AIM and Internet Explorer. I remember when Netscape and ICQ were basically the only things you could use for their respective purposes, so I don't see how continuing to use them makes me a rebel. I still believe they are the best programs available for their purposes (the older versions, that is; I refuse to touch Netscape 6 or ICQ 2000 or newer with a stick).
<br>
<br>A few days ago, <A href="index6ed0.html?day=020112">Nancy</a> thought it would be a good idea to untie my shoe when I wasn't looking, then tighten it such that I couldn't feel my toes. This wouldn't normally be a problem, except for the fact that I've had my shoelaces prefectly calibrated and untouched for the past 2 years or more. Now that my left shoe is decidedly more uncomfortable than my right, and I'm too lazy to go through the hassle and couple months of work it takes to fix it, I figure I'll just buy some new shoes. I'm open to suggestions as to which variety I should purchase.
<br>
<br>I'm going to talk some more about PBS now in hopes of finding somebody else who loves their documentaries. A few days ago I watched one about January 28, 1998, a day when some massive waves hit Oahu's North Shore. A few professional big wave surfers managed to get out to the one spot that was actually surfable and ride some 40-80 foot waves. The best part was that some guys with IMAX cameras were there in a helicopter (piloted by a Vietnam war veteran, no less) to film it all. The result was some really cool footage. I am not, however, a fan of the children's shows on PBS, since most of them are either gay love fests ("Teletubbies", "Thomas the train", "Noddy") or make kids really hyper ("Between the Lions", and to a lesser extent "Sesame Street"). I'd say most cartoons are more educational than PBS shows. Anyways, the other day I caught a few minutes from a show about JJ the Jet plane, his friend Big Jake, and the (and this is a direct quote) "special time [they] spend together every night." Usually the programs I catch late at night are real gems, though. Lately they've been showing a strange show called "The Second Voyage of the Mimi", which seems to be about archaeology and ancient Mezoamerican cultures. The kicker is that its main character is none other than a very young Ben Affleck. Probably my favorite educational show on PBS very late at night is "Project Mathematics", a series of episodes created by Caltech to teach Mathematics. For a long time I had dreamt about revolutionizing the way mathematics are taught (in my opinion, public schools go about it very poorly), but this show does almost everything I wanted to, and better than I could have. While I haven't seen very many ones on concepts I haven't learned, it gives the history behind everything they talk about, all to a very well timed classical score. There are very few things I would like more than to speak with the man who is behind the creation of Project Mathematics.
<br>
<br>Hmm, I got a bit carried away with that last paragraph, and have now forgotten the final topic I was going to talk about. Hopefully I'll remember by tomorrow, and can relay the information then.
