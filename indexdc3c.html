	Well, this was the first comic written by Chad. If you ever happen upon a comic in the future where death is involved, or at least very horrible physical damage is caused, the script was probably influenced by Chad. =)<br><br>Brook's cat just tried to kill Brook's cellphone, he's lucky I was here to prevent this catastrophic event from happening. Poor phone, Brook's already dropped it so many times that a new batter had to be placed into it... funny thing is, Brook was forced to purchase an "extended-life battery" so now the phone has a large protruding part sticking out of the back of it. It's the big-butt phone now.<br><br>I remember my first OS installation... <strike>good ole'</strike> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/default.asp" target="_blank">Windows 95</a>! I actually enjoyed the DOS days more... which reminds me... <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/companystore/tiefighter/" target="_blank">TIE Fighter</a> was a darn good game. I'm going to have to get me that game again, I think my <a href="http://www.accurite.com/FloppyPrimer.html" target="_blank">floppies</a> (yes, kiddies, games and other applications used to be on these plastic non-reflective square disks that if you opened it up and glared at for more than three seconds would corrupt the entire contents it held within) have all been corrupted. I think they have an updated Windows version of that game with a bit higher resolution for $5 or $10... I hope they do, cause I don't think the DOS version runs on XP or 2000...<br><br>My goal of this post is to somehow reach the length of Mark's and/or Brook's. Although I'm not nearly as entertaining or talented in my writing as said two, I'm going to blabber on nonetheless. Hopefully, Chad will actually write something for a change, or we may have to convert his spot to "Guest" rather than devote it solely to Chad.<br><br>I'd like to share with you a poem I wrote during one of my self-paced courses, <a href="http://www.ece.utexas.edu/projects/ee316/" target="_blank">EE316</a>:<br><br><blockquote><i>Logic smogic;<br>Hobbit gunk.<br>Watch me fly,<br>Hop hop hop...<br>Fire in the hole!<br>here comes the...<br>BOOM!</i></blockquote>Interpret as you please, your guess is as good as mine. Also during EE316, I happened to be doodling on my notebook paper when I made a line really weird... attempting to erase said line, I thought to myself: "<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q126449" target="_blank">CTRL-Z</a>" and somehow expected the line to disappear on it's own. People tell me I spend too much time on the computer...<br><br>I'm sitting here with a blank stare looking at the computer screen. I believe this means I should stop soon. <br><br>Have you seen the new screenshots for <a href="http://cube.ign.com/news/38335.html" target="_blank">Resident Evil</a>? They look pretty nice! Especially <a href="http://cubemedia.ign.com/media/previews/image/residentevil/feature/gcnrecompare8.jpg" target="_blank">this one</a>. Wow.<br><br>I've got a bear at home with a big butt. His name's BBB - Big Butt Bear.<br><br>With that said, I'd like to say bye.<br><br>Bye.</font></td></tr>

	    Well... I just updated my OS to windows XP... <br><br>    So far, so good.  After some intial difficulties with my Sony Clie and hotsyncing it... I am back on track and in the groove. <br><a href="http://www.hatsofmeat.com/">Neat Meat</a> I hope though that I can find my photoshop and flash cds, as I need those programs to do some stuff... oh, and I would also like to find my Office cd... for obvious reasons.  <br><br>As it turns out, my hard drive was being abused by Windows 98... the stupid OS was using 5 gig of my hard drive for what seemed to me like lard.  ARG.  But now I have the full 25 gig at my disposal... MWAHAHAHAH.  <br><br>That is all for today... Oliver is breathing down my throat to make his post... oh and Mark has my Sun Chips... bastard.</font></td></tr>

	I'm going to have to disagree with Chad here (though only slightly). Brook manages to find some of the strangest music out there, and some of it is fantastic. The overwhelming majority of it is soul-sucking evil, though. About the only good thing about listening to Brook's music is that he has the attention span of a rabbit in heat, and rarely finishes listening to a single song (much less an entire CD) before switching tracks or CDs. On the rare occasion he's playing a song you like, then you're out of luck.<br><br>Today's my grandpa's birthday; he's 88 now. Despite popular believe (mostly thanks to Brook's stories) he's anything but senile… just pretty silly sometimes. I hope that I'm as happy and (relatively) healthy when I'm his age. Actually, I hope they've cured all the major diseases I don't look forward to (colon cancer, heart disease, etc…), but if they haven't, then I hope to be as healthy as he is.<br><br>Last night at Brook's house I built a gliding spaceship thingy with a massive death cannon on a turret out of everyone's favorite Danish toy, Legos [Update: I erroneously had Legos originating from Finland, when in fact they're from Denmark. I was going to say it didn't matter because they were all part of the Swedish empire at some point in time, but it turns out Sweden never really conquered any part of Denmark.]. Unfortunately, it's not very stable if you pick it up (I sacrificed a lot of stability for aesthetic purposes), but the death cannon is really neat. It can swivel 360° left to right and 90° up and down, effectively allowing it to target anything around it (unless said object is very low to the ground). Additionally, the amplifier thing at the end of the cannon can spin like a wheel. I should have taken some pictures… I hope Brook, Hunter, or their cats didn't destroy it.<br><br>When I got home, there was another Mark Twain documentary on PBS, which was distinctly different than the one I watched before. It looked older, and wasn't as good (in my opinion) as the one I watched before, but it had a few interesting things that the other left out (or maybe they were incorrect, and the new one left them out for good reason). I didn't see enough of it to make a good comparison, though, because I fell asleep.<br><br>I've got a bunch of other neat things to say, but I'll save those for another time since I'm adding this so late. 'Til then!</font></td></tr>

	Alright, well, they finally gave me the motivation i need to type in some space filler...  Actually, i figured that since my voice is pretty much grounded, and i feel like crap, i might as well go for some ungodly length.  Speaking of length, enjoy this plug: <a href="chad/index.html">HERE!!!</a>.<br><br>Alrighty, well, today's comic yes indeed was conjured up from the depths of my head.  The decency of this action is often called into question, but i say, relative to the OPINIONATED matter at hand, you decide for yourselves. The purpose of this space here is going to be to clue all you in as to the origin of today's strip, and that would be simply this:  Brook's music, it's horrible...<br><br>Lemme tell you something else that was horrible: Nazis.<br><br>Apply syllogism and you're pretty freakin close, and though typically that would be a fallacy, in this case it's not, trust me...<br><br>yeah, so, final summation: Brook's music sucks.<br><br>and on a not so final note, maybe you'll appreciate the final note of the comic, maybe not.<br><br>And just to further the utter truth of the previous note, Oliver is a blatant Chinaman, and i don't know quite how i feel about that...<br><br><br><br><br></font></td></tr>
