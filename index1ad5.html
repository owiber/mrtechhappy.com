	I remember actually falling off an ice bridge in Survivor (the map... not the show... you know, I really shouldn't have needed to clarify that. If you thought I meant the show, you're not worthy of reading this. Begone. No, wait... we need your hits. Nevermind, stay. =)... it really stunk, I think I died from that.
<br>
<br>Which reminds me... that was at our last LAN party during a game where everyone was off doing something except Brook, Mark, and myself... it was Brook and Mark versus me in Survivor. And they were T and I was CT, dang it! You know how hard it is to "defend" two bomb sites then go into the bomb site and try to defuse and destroy the enemy BY YOURSELF WHEN THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE CAMPING BY THE CURSED BOMB!?!!
<br>
<br>Alright, I'm calm now. Well, in all except that bomb map when it was 2v1 and I was CT... I cleaned up at that LAN party. When we played Vertigo (I think?), Chad and Brook would jump off the side leaving it 4v1 (me being the 1) and I would hunt and destroy every single one of them. Yeah baby.
<br>
<br>Alright, enjoy the comic, now for a word from <strike>our sponsors</strike> the fool brigade:</font></td></tr>

	Another day, another post.  Tonight, I did in fact go see Brotherhood of the Wolf... or Le Pact... blabla (if you are french).  I must say that, contrary to Chad and Oliver's opinion of the movie, I thought it was excellent.  Not exactly a top 10 on my list... but it would make the hundred.  The enjoyment was there though... especially during the groovy fight scenes and "beast" chases.  I don't want to give away any of the movie... but I will say that if you like neat fights and a passable storyline... then go see BOTW.  Hey, at least it is better than The One.
<br>
<br>My opinion of French people after watching BOTW and Amelie has been raised...  Hopefully this next week I will get to watch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6302662745/qid=1011608355/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_67_1/002-8163070-5836049">Delicatessen,</a> which should (I'm told) raise my opinion much, much more.
<br>
<br>Oh, and by the way, if the previews at the beginnning of BOTW are the same in all theaters... then you should be treated to the new flick by the Crouching Tiger guy.  Woo!  This time, the fighters have "magic" and computer animation flingy stuff.  Poof!
<br>
<br>This is day 2 of the XP invasion on my system... and it seems to be doing well.  I like it, it likes me... now if I could just get it to be friends with explorer... Though after a restart it seems to be fine again.  Yay!  Gripe #2 is the fact that I have to go out and buy a NEW Norton SystemWorks... ARG!  Because of the need for cashmoney, Symatec is now <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2000-10-23">having their pants filled with it by Microsoft, obviously.</a>
<br>
<br>Well... off to bed now... (It is officially 4:16am here in Brook-Land)  I need to get up again in 7 hours to go to Musical practice... arg.  After that, the team and I should be slaving away at another few comic gems... or at least some cubic zerconiums...  Oh well.  Night</font></td></tr>
     	<tr><td width="725"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFCC00"><a name="mark"><a href="mailto:mark@mrtechhappy.com"><img border="0" src="mark.jpg" align="left" width="141" height="64"></a>
	Today is an awfully self explanatory continuation of the CS saga, with a bit of a twist. The girls must not like cold climates, and Oliver and Brook are too stupid to wait for the time on the round to run out so they can win. The map is de_survivor for those of you unacquainted, and there's actually an ice bridge that crumbles when you walk on it.
<br>
<br>I always find the music lyrics at the end of <A HREF="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Tycho's</A> news posts pretty interesting. Judging by how often a song is playing in my head (I'll give you a hint: pretty much all the time), I thought to myself "I can do that!" Then I decided that I needed a gimmick to make me better than Tycho, so I'm going to attempt to slip them in normally during the post and see if you guys can catch them. I will do my best to not alter the lyric(s) at all, but obviously the stuff preceding and following it will be different than in the song. If I decide not to do it on any given day, I'll say so (or maybe I won't, just to watch you guys scramble for my own morbid pleasure). I'll forewarn you that most of the lyrics will be from Oldies songs, not because of any particular preference, but merely for the fact that they get stuck in my head most often. Post on the forum if you think you know the song, and if the game gets popular enough, Oliver could add a special area devoted just to this purpose.
<br>
<br><B>This is the paragraph containing today's song lyric. Nobody guessed it, because they suck. Most of the information contained herein is exaggerated for the purpose of containing the song lyric, but feel free to read it anyway. To find out what song it is, go to <a href="index1eeb.html?day=020122#mark">the next post.</a></b><i>
<br>For those of you who are unaware, I don't go outside during the day much. I'm not necessarily adverse to the sun, and often enjoy the sunlight shining on me through a window, but there's usually little reason for me to go out then. As added incentive, the few people I do meet late at night generally tend to be less idiotic than those I meet during the day. Anyways, when I looked outside today I was surprised to find that all the leaves are brown, and the sky is grey. I had gotten awfully used to leaves not falling out until almost springtime (when the new leaves push them out), and I can't think of what could have caused this. It wasn't colder this year than it was last year, so that's not it… It's more of a problem in my neighbor's yard than in mine. I really wish they'd rake it so the leaves don't blow into our garage and such.</i>
<br>
<br>I was bored waiting for Brook and Oliver to contact me about today's comic (turns out they were having a wacky adventure without me; hopefully more on that tomorrow), so I added news posts to all the comics I hadn't so far (which I'd been meaning to do for a few days now). Ideally, you'd all go out and read the entire archives and all my posts for anything you may have missed, but I compiled a list below for you lazy bums. If you're a newcomer who'se reading through the archives for the first time, welcome! You've already read my posts for those comics (if you haven't, shame on you!) and you can ignore the following list.
<br><a href="index04db.html?day=010722#mark">Like a Monkey!</a>
<br><a href="index960a.html?day=010728#mark">Beach Trouble</a>
<br><a href="index37c9.html?day=020101#mark">New Style!</a>
<br><a href="index2eb9.html?day=020105#mark">Don't Smoke</a>
<br><a href="index31ec.html?day=020108#mark">The Claw!</a>
<br><a href="index9d73.html?day=020109#mark">MMORPG</a>

<br>and <a href="index6ed0.html?day=020112#mark">AOE2 and Nancy</a>
<br>
<br>Looks like I ended up using none of the topics I had leftover from yesterday… Oh well.</font></td></tr>
